# Ground_water_quality_detection-ML
Groundwater Quality Classification using SVM This project involves the analysis and classification of groundwater quality data collected over three years (2018, 2019, and 2020). The goal is to predict the groundwater quality classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels.
